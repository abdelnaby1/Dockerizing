we combine the docker-compose file that contains the hub and browsers services with our script container/service

right now if we combine all together in docker-compose file and run docker-compose up, it will not run the test if
the docker file with this content FROM bellsoft/liberica-openjdk-alpine:17.0.8

                                  WORKDIR /home/selenium-docker

                                  Add target/docker-resources ./

                                  ENTRYPOINT java -Dselenium.grid.enabled=true \
                                          -Dselenium.gird.hubHost=${HUB_HOST} \
                                          -Dbrowser=${BROWSER} \
                                          -cp 'libs/*' org.testng.TestNG -threadcount ${THREAD_COUNT} test-suites/${TEST_SUITE}

why?
as the hub status is still not ready as the browsers nodes still register themself even if the script
service depends on hub, so we need to run the test only when the hub has status of ready

to check the status of the hub cURL GET 'http://localhost:4444/status'

so we need to change our dokcerfile to wait of running the test until the hub is ready
we need to use curl and jq to check the status and extract it from the response using jq
